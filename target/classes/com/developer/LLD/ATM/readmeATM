Designing a Low-Level Design (LLD) for an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) involves defining the architecture, classes, and relationships between various components of the system.
The ATM system consists of various components such as the ATM machine, bank server, card reader, cash dispenser, etc.

1. System Requirements
    Functional Requirements:
        Cash withdrawal
        Cash deposit
        Balance inquiry
        Transfer funds
        Mini statement generation
        PIN change
    Non-functional Requirements:
        Security (PIN verification, encryption)
        High availability
        Scalability
        Reliability


We need to keep track of this events, for which we can define different states of the ATM

READY — Ready to accept card

ENTER PIN — Wait for the user to enter PIN, once they have inserted the card

SELECT TRANSACTION — Wait for the user to select a transaction

DEPOSIT — Wait for user to insert cash, once they have selected the deposit cash option

WITHDRAW — Wait for user to input required amount, once they have selected the withdraw cash option

DISPLAY BALANCE — Display account balance once the transaction is over and wait for the user to decide the next transaction or exit

CASH DISPENSED — Dispense cash once the transaction is over and wait for the user to collect it

ERROR MESSAGE DISPLAYED — Display error message if the ATM has insufficient cash or user’s account has insufficient balance and wait the user to decide the next transaction or exit

INVALID CASH RETURNED — Return invalid currency if any found once the transaction is over and wait for the user to collect it

EXIT MESSAGE DISPLAYED — Display exit message once user exits and return the card

 classes for our design will be:

        ATM
        User
        Account
        Card
        Cash
